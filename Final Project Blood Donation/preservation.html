        <p>
            The first anticoagulant preservative was introduced by Rous and Turner in 1916. It consisted of a citrate-glucose solution in which blood from rabbits was stored for two weeks, which prevented anaemia when transfused in another rabbit who had suffered from blood loss. Rous Turner's solution as used for storage of human blood during the First World War (Mollison 1987). The next important development occurred in 1943 during the Second World War when acidifieditrate dextrose (ACD) solution was introduced for clinical use by Loutit and Mollison.In 1957 Gibson et al developed an improved preservative of citrate-phosphate-dextrose (CPD), which was less acidic than ACD and maintained 2,3-iphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) level better than in ACD solution. CPD eventually replaced ACD and became commonly used preservative for storage of blood/red cells in liquid form. Shelf-lifeof blood stored in CPD at 2-4 °C was 21 day.
            <br>
            In 1978 citrate-phosphate-dextrose with adenine (CPDA-1) preservative was developed. The addition of adenine improved the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the stored blood,which prolonged the storage of blood/red cells at 2-4 °C to 35 days.

        <h3>Plastic Bags </h3>
        <p>
            Many other factors may limit the viability of transfused red cells. One of the factors is also the plastic material used for the bags. The plastic material should be sufficiently permeable to CO2 in order to maintain higher pH during storage. Currently the blood is stored in plastic bags made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) with plasticizer, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). It is known that DEHP leaches from plastic into plasma and cell membrane during storage and may be harmful to the patient. The accumulation of excessive amount of acid due to glycosis even at low storage temperature is also a major problem in liquid preservation of red cells. So there is need to develop improved plastic blood bags as well as preservative solutions.

        <h3>RED CELL FREEZING</h3>
        <p>
            Smith in 1950 reported that glycerol could prevent freezing injury in human red cells and that red cells, mixed with glycerol could be frozen without damage.
        </p>
        <h3>Decrease in pH</h3>
        <p>
            When blood is stored at 2-6 °C, glycosis is reduced but does not stop. Giycosis results in the production of lactate, with subsequent decrease in pH. Whole blood collected in CPD has a pH7.20 on day 0 and 6.84 on day 21. Preservative solutions provide buffering capability to minimize pH changes and optimize the storage period.
        </p>
        <h3>Loss of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)</h3>
        <p>
            ATP is associated with the red cells viability. Loss of ATP causes increase in cellular rigidity and decrease in red cell membrane integrity and deformability. A decrease in ATP allows the leak of Na+ and K+ through red cell membrane at levels exceeding those normally seen in vivo. The ATP level in CPDA-1 red cells at day 35 is 45 % (±12) of the initial level.
        </p>
        <h3>Adenine</h3>
        <p>
            Simon (1962) showed that in CPD solution supplemented with 17 mg (0.25 mm) adenine per 63 of anticoagulant and 25% more dextrose, the survival of red cells 24 hours after transfusionof blood stored for 35 days was 80 ± 6.5 %. Adenine synthesizes ATP and its level is 56.4 ± 15.9%of the initial level in the stored blood for five weeks. Adenine nephrotoxicity due to its unmetabolized product, 2,8-dioxyadenine, is negligible at a level of 15mg/kg body weight. This amount is present in 30 units of fresh CPD adenine (0.5mM/unit) blood or in 60 units each having 0.25 mM adenine The quantity of adenine is less if red cells are used.
        </p>
        <h3>Changes inNa+and K+ levels</h3>
        <p>
            During refrigerated storage, Na+ and K+ leak through the red cell membrane rapidly. The cells lose and gain Na+, however, the K+ loss is greater than the Na+ gain during storage.
        </p>
        <h3>Temperature</h3>
        <p>
            The lower temperature keeps the rate of glycolysis at lower limit and minimizes the proliferationof bacteria that might have entered the blood unit during venipuncture or from atmosphere. The rate of diffusion of electrolytes (Na* and K+) across the cell membrane is also less at lower temperature.
        </p>
        <h3>Additive Solutions</h3>
        <p>
            Traditional preservatives were put into use when whole blood was the major product. With the advent of component therapy use of red cells increased. This resulted in several problems in preservation. In preparing red cell concentrates 40% adenine and glucose present in CPDA-1 solution is removed with plasma and there is decrease in viability of the red cells, particularly in the last two weeks of storage. Red cell concentrates relatively void of plasma are more viscous and difficult to infuse in emergency situations. To overcome this problem red cell concentratesare prepared with hematocrits of less than 80%. This allows adequate plasma to remain for red cells nourishment and to improve flow properties. This results in lower plasma yields, affecting fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate production.
            <br>
            The use of additive solutions allows recovery of maximum amount of plasma and preparation of red cells unit with a final hematocrit of about 60%. This new blood collection system has a primary bag containing a standard anticoagulant (CPD) and a satellite bag containing an additive solution. Blood is collected in the primary bag containing anticoagulant solution. After the plasmais removed from the whole blood into another empty satellite bag, the additive solution is added to the red cells, thus providing nutrients to red cells for improved viability. The red cells can be stored for six weeks at 2-6°C. The additive solution should be added to red cells within 72 hours since phlebotomy.
            <br>
            Three additive solutions are available (1) Adsol ( AS-1 ) [Baxter Laboratories], (2) Nutricel (AS-3) [Medsep Corporation, formerly Cutter Biologicals] and Optisol (AS-5) [TerumoCorporation |.

        <h3>Heparin</h3>
        <p>
            Heparin prevents coagulation by inactivating the prophylactic activity of thrombin after complexing with AT 111 and thrombin. 1000 IU of heparin is equal to 10 mg heparin but IU and mg are not strictly interchangeable because commercial preparations of heparin vary in composition.
            Dose of heparin for anticoagulation is 0.5-2.0 IU/ml. of blood e.g. approximately 500 IU of heparin for 500 ml of blood. Heparinized blood should be used within 24 hours. Earlier heparinized blood was used in pen heart surgery but now usually it is not used as extracorporeal pumps are now usually primedwith crystalloids and not with blood. The effect of heparin can be neutralized with protamine sulphate. 1 mg of protamine sulphate neutralizes 1 mg of heparin e.g. to neutralize 5000 units of heparin (50 mg), 5 ml of 1 % solution of protamine sulphate will be needed.
        </p>
        <h3>Effect of Freezing</h3>
        <p>
            It is believed that freezing damages red cells due to the intracellular ice formation and probably to some extent due to hypertonicity. If glycerol (cryoprotective agent) is added to the cells they can be frozen and thawed without damage (Polge et al. 1949). The effect of the glycerol is probably due to the fact that it limits ice formation and provides liquid phase in which salts are distributed as cooling proceeds excessive hypertonicity is also avoided (Lovelock, 1953). Glycerol which termeates red cells fairly rapidly during freezing is most effective in protecting the human redcells.
            <br>
            Frozen red cells are primarily used for autologous transfusion and the storage of rare group blood. For freezing red cells a cryoprotective agent is added to red cells that are less than 6 days old. Glycerol is used most commonly and is added to the red cells slowly with vigorous shaking so that glycerol permeates into the red cells. The cells are rapidly frozen and stored in a freezer.The freezing and storage temperature depends on the concentration of glycerol. Two concentrations are used to freeze red cells, a high concentration glycerol |40% weight in volume (w/v) and a low concentration glycerol [20% weight in volume (w/v)] in the final concentration of cryopreservative. Most blood banks use the high glycerol technique.
