            Florence Nightingale, more than 100  any hospital or ward could be pronounced than the single  (infectious) disease has originated in it, or that such a disease has attacked other patients than those brought in with them”.
            <br>
            It should, therefore, be obligatory on those who are involved in transfusion of blood to a patient for saving his life, that the blood transfusion does, no harm to the patient. Nothing could be worst than the fact that in an attempt to save life, blood &amp; blood products having transmissible infectious agents have been given. Many of these infectious agents may cause death or prolonged illness. Hence it is necessary to understand the organisms which could be transmitted through blood transfusion and means by which this could be prevented.

        <h3>Infectious agents</h3>
        <p>
            There are four main groups of micro-organisms known to cause infections namely viruses, bacteria, protozoa and fungi  Only first three groups of microbes - viruses, bacteria and protozoa - have been reported to be transmitted by blood transfusion. Individuals with fungal infections are usually too sick to be accepted as blood donors. Viruses are most commonly transmitted by transfusion.
            <br>
            Recently, a new form of infectious agent - the prion - has been identified. At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that they could be transmitted by blood transfusion.

        <h3>Viruses</h3>
        <p>
            Viruses are the simplest forms of life. They infect all forms of life, they lack certain components needed to live and their growth hence depend on the host cell that they infect to provide these missing components .
            <br>
            Following are some of the viruses which are known to be transmitted through blood:
        <ol>
            <li>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)</li>
            <li>Hepatitis B virus</li>
            <li>Hepatitis C virus</li>
            <li>Hepatitis A virus</li>
            <li>Hepatitis G virus</li>
            <li>Non - A, Non - B Hepatitis</li>
            <li>Epstein Barr Virus</li>
            <li>Cytomegalo virus (CMV)</li>
            <li>Human T Lymphocytic virus (HTLV - 1 &amp; HTLV - 2)</li>
        </ol>
