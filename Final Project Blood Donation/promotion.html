            Blood transfusion services have gained significant importance and momentum in view of HIV infection. The efficacy of transmission of HIV through blood and blood products is 100% and screening of the blood for HIV can eliminate this mode of transmission to a large extent.
            <br><br>
            There are also other diseases which can be transmitted through blood which can be addressed as Transfusion Transmitted Diseases (T.T.D) They are Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Malaria, Syphilis.
            <br><br>
            The ultimate aim of blood banks and transfusion services is to provide safe blood.Blood can be made safe by the following ways:
            <br>
            ->Collection of blood from healthy persons absolutely on voluntary donation,
            <br>
            ->Adoption of good manufacturing practices: Screening of blood for T D D.using highly sensitive and specific tests,
            <br>
            <img src="side.jpg" alt="need" style="width:700px;height:200px;"> 
            <br><br>
            ->Practicing rational use of blood: This needs better emphasis, so that unnecessary transfusion is avoided. A single unit transfusion needs to be stopped, and to encourage use of blood components, Autologous transfusion in cold planned cases.
            <br><br>
            Blood Banks need to concentrate basically on collection of blood from healthy individuals. This can be done by meticulous selection of donors and by encouraging voluntary donation.
            <br><br>
            In a historical judgment Supreme Court of India, banned buying and selling of blood with effect from 1st January 98. Hence it is imperative to make available safe blood. As a result voluntary donation of blood should be promoted in the community.
            <br><br>
            The efforts are in progress to improve the percentage of voluntary blood donation in the State. By the end of December 1998, blood collection by voluntary donation has improved to 46% from 38% in 1997.
            To achieve 100% voluntary donation by 2010 A.D. it is necessary to prepare an action plan and make concerted efforts by the health administrators as well as by the community. There is a need for long programming so that voluntary blood donation becomes a public movement and life style of the younger generation.
            <br><br>
            Thus there is a need for launching an Intensive voluntary blood donation campaign in the state.
            <br><br>
